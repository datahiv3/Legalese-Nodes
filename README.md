# Legalese Nodes

## Project Description
Legalese Nodes is a comprehensive framework for managing, processing, and storing legal data across multiple versions (LN1 through LN5). This repository serves as a high-level overview and central hub for the entire Legalese Nodes ecosystem.

For a more detailed overview of the Legalese Nodes ecosystem, including key features, functions, and technical specifications, please refer to our comprehensive document:
[Legalese Nodes Ecosystem Overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EKGdM-35KMS_HiNZ3x4QjaO_T5-QNiXhy-1HNbWFZto/edit)


## Purpose
1. **Project Overview**: Provides a comprehensive view of the Legalese Nodes ecosystem.
2. **Roadmap**: Outlines the development plans and milestones for all LN versions.
3. **Sample Code**: Contains example implementations and code snippets for each LN version.
4. **Documentation**: Houses high-level documentation applicable across all LN versions.
5. **Preliminary Releases**: Includes early-stage releases for testing and feedback.

## Key Features
- [Legal Data Indexing and Curation](./docs/Legal_Data_Indexing_and_Curation.md)
- [Legal Intelligence Layer](./docs/Legal_Intelligence_Layer.md)
- [Library of Legal Products](./docs/Library_of_Legal_Products.md)
- [Legal Data Dictionary](./docs/Legal_Data_Dictionary.md)
- [Legal Text Network](./docs/Legal_Text_Network.md)
- [Integration with Consent Nodes and Data Assetization Nodes](./docs/Integration_with_Other_Nodes.md)

## Repository Structure

This structure reflects the actual organization of the Legalese-Nodes repository, including:

- A `docs` directory for documentation
- A `scripts` directory for utility scripts
- A `src` directory containing:
  - A `common` folder for shared code
  - Separate directories for each Legalese Node version (ln1 through ln5)
- A `tests` directory for test files
- The main README.md file at the root level

This structure allows for organized development of each Legalese Node version while providing common resources and clear separation of documentation, source code, and tests.

## Version-Specific Details
### LN1
- Basic functionality for initializing and managing legal data.
- Key features include data storage and user authentication.

### LN2
- Enhanced data processing capabilities.
- Introduces consent management features and reporting tools.

### LN3
- Adds support for advanced data assetization and analytics.
- Enhanced interoperability with other node types.

### LN4
- Incorporates machine learning for predictive analytics.
- Enhanced security protocols for data handling.

### LN5
- Full integration with external legal APIs.
- Advanced user interfaces for better interaction with the node.


### Individual Node Repositories

Each Legalese Node version (LN1 through LN5) has its own dedicated repository:

- LN1: 
    - Private: https://github.com/datahiv3/LN1
    - Public: https://github.com/datahiv3/Legalese-Node-LN1
- LN2: 
  - Public: [Link to public LN2 repo]
  - Private: [Link to private LN2 repo]
- LN3: 
  - Public: [Link to public LN3 repo]
  - Private: [Link to private LN3 repo]
- LN4: 
  - Public: [Link to public LN4 repo]
  - Private: [Link to private LN4 repo]
- LN5: 
  - Public: [Link to public LN5 repo]
  - Private: [Link to private LN5 repo]

These individual repositories contain the detailed implementation, documentation, and version-specific code for each Legalese Node version. The public repositories contain open-source components and general information, while the private repositories house sensitive or proprietary code and data.

Developers and contributors should refer to the specific repository for each Legalese Node version when working on or deploying that particular node type.
